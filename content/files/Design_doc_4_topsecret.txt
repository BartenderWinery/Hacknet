Secretary Simulator 2012
Tagline: "From the people who brought you utility vehicle simulator, gardening simulator and grocery simulator comes Secretary Simulator 2012 - manage virtual files, respond to virtual memos, - the full office experience, all from the comfort of your own computer! It's so intense you'll be reaching for your tie and coffee!"

Features:
-Virtual spreadsheets (spreadsheet minigame)
-Virtual office meetings (dialogue tree, this is what player alignment is based on)
-Virtual memos (randomly generated flavor text, also serve as tutorial mission)
-Virtual desk (similar to house interior decorating in other games, player is able to move and arrange various objects on their desk)
-Virtual phone calls (quicktime events)
-Virtual Basic

Notes: 
-alignments: The alignment system is based on a 2D alignment grid - similar to "political alignment" charts. The two spectrums are Slacker/Diligent and Lawful/Chaotic. The player's alignment is determined by their responses in meetings
-multiple endings: also determined by meeting responses. 5 "normal" endings based on alignment & choices in mission (promotion ending, laid off ending, company merger ending, shit on coworkers' desks ending (chaotic slacker only) and promoted to CEO ending), 1 "special" ending (awarded after reaching 100% completion in paperclip and spreadsheet minigame)
Mission q: 
Due to fourth quarter revenue decreases, we've been forced to remove the popular "mission 4" and replace it with a "screensaver simulator". This is actually just an image of a cat which slowly rotates and changes colour. [NB: Steve: Can we replace this with one of the files in the "Printer Drivers" folder?"] [NB: Admin: No, there is no printer driver folder. The printer driver folder is a frequently propagated myth around this office and frankly I am disgusted that you believed such lies, Steve. I am leaving this here as a reminder to all employees.]
