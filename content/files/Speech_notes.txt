Speech Notes for companywide presentation Friday!!!! DO NOT FORGET!!! 
Staying on the Cutting Edge: Going Forward towards Synergy

-Facebook Integration: in this technological age, we must integrate the facebook in our strategic gameplan to maximize profits and minimize overheads
-Synergy: for maximum workplace productivity, we must synergize to obtain a win-win scenario going forward
-Social Media: we must create a knowledge base of social media and e-commerce to get the edge in our customer-oriented field
-Overclocking the CPU: We need to go live: widen the social content pipeline and up our bandwidth to increase e-online-penetration and quadruple our revenue 
-Quality Driven Approach: Empowering solutions give us the wow-factor on the web 2.0 (Note: i think this is the second internet being built next to the other internet, check with paul before friday?) (also ask paul to fix my printer) (also ask paul why the printer "drivers folder" is always locked)
-Our Roadmap to the Future: A top-down approach to e-solutions - monetizing our customer-based approach and reconfiguring the market to increase our revenue
