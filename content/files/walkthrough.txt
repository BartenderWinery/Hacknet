Sup bros, today im gonna be walking you thru the newest sensation in the world of grocery-based simulations, grocery simulator 2010.

in this game, your John Citizen: a grocer, who's life gets flipped turned upside down (lol!) and has to sell all sorts of crazy shit to make some sweeeet $$$$.

So first things 1st: the HUD. The HUD is wwhere you can see what ailes need refilling, where theirs a cleanup needed & how many customers you have. If u get stuck, you can turn on grocervision, witch will point yuo to the most importent job you gotta do. To walk around, you use e (forward) s (left), d (back), and f(strafe left), and z to backflip and use item (basically use this do do whatever job ur closest to, like mopping or stocking). TIP: It may not look like ur character is walking, but if you look closely you can see there moving its just that there feet dont move.
