Mrs. Calley's Grade 7 Class
Film Study assignment 4 (due week 6)

This week we watched "The Human Centipede (first sequence)" as a class. It is now your task to answer the following questions about the film. Remember, the assignments are due at the end of week 6. You will receive a grade from A+ (85% and up) to A (below 85%). 

Question 1: At the start of the film, the two girls are captured by an insane doctor and subjected to horrifying acts of torture. If you were to be in their situation, how would you feel, and if your feelings were a colour, which colour would they be?

Question 2: The film is touted as "100% Medically Accurate". Do you agree with this statement? Provide two science facts to support your claim.

Question 3: Can you devise a more effective method of creating a "human centipede" which would not result in some of the medical conditions suffered by the film's victims? Provide a diagram and several science facts along with a written version of your plan.
