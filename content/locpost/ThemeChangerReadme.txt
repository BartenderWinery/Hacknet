-- Theme Changer Readme --

This program allows for fast hot-swapping of x-server theme files from local and remote connected sources.
"Files in the "Remote" row are remotely hosted valid theme files in the currently navigated folder on a
connected machine. Files in the "Local" row are locally hosted theme files in the home or sys folder.
ThemeChanger allows a user to select any of these, and will automatically download it's contents into 
x-server.sys in the system folder, and activate the system theme without the need for a reboot.
The program will also automatically back up existing themes so that all known styles are preserved 
for future use.
